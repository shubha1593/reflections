What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git file is added in the directory which we want to turn into a git 
repository which stores the metadata about the history of the files in 
the repository. Initially there is no commit, we have to make it ourselves.
That makes sense as we might not want the current state o be committed and
also we would to assoiate a meaningful message with the commit. So all files 
are untracked currently.
